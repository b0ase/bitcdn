BitCDN is a revolutionary content delivery network that leverages the power of BitTorrent for decentralized file distribution and integrates micropayments using BitcoinSV (BSV). This innovative approach aims to create a more efficient, cost-effective, and equitable system for content creators and consumers alike.

## How it Works

At its core, BitCDN combines two powerful technologies:

*   **BitTorrent:** For robust and scalable peer-to-peer file sharing. This allows for efficient distribution of large files without relying on centralized servers, reducing bandwidth costs and improving download speeds.
*   **BitcoinSV (BSV) Micropayments:** To facilitate tiny, seamless transactions between users and content providers. This enables new monetization models where users can pay small amounts for the content they consume or for their contribution to the network (e.g., seeding files).

## The Vision

We envision a future where content delivery is no longer a bottleneck or a significant expense. BitCDN aims to empower:

*   **Content Creators:** By providing a direct and fair way to monetize their work, bypassing traditional intermediaries.
*   **Users:** By offering faster access to content and the ability to support creators directly through micropayments. They will be able to download a dedicated client application from our website to participate in the network.
*   **The Network:** By incentivizing participation (seeding) and ensuring its long-term health and decentralization.

We are building a client application that users can download from the project's website to easily connect to the BitCDN network, share files, and make/receive micropayments.
