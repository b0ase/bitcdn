    <h1>bitcdn</h1>

    <p>BitCDN is a revolutionary content delivery network that leverages the power of BitTorrent for decentralized file distribution and integrates micropayments using BitcoinSV (BSV). This innovative approach aims to create a more efficient, cost-effective, and equitable system for content creators and consumers alike. We plan to build upon existing, proven open-source BitTorrent implementations to accelerate development and ensure robustness.</p>

    <h2>How it Works</h2>

    <p>At its core, BitCDN combines two powerful technologies and a novel economic model:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>BitTorrent:</strong> For robust and scalable peer-to-peer file sharing. This allows for efficient distribution of large files without relying on centralized servers, reducing bandwidth costs and improving download speeds.</li>
        <li><strong>BitcoinSV (BSV) Micropayments:</strong> To facilitate tiny, seamless transactions between users and content providers. This enables new monetization models. A key aspect of this model is that <strong>seeders (those who share files) get paid directly by downloaders (those who consume files)</strong> for their contribution to the network.</li>
        <li><strong>Decentralized Architecture:</strong> By moving away from centralized points of control, BitCDN aims to overcome the fragility and bottlenecks inherent in current CDN architectures. This distributed nature inherently provides greater resilience and scalability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Vision</h2>

    <p>We envision a future where content delivery is no longer a bottleneck or a significant expense. BitCDN aims to empower:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Content Creators:</strong> By providing a direct and fair way to monetize their work, bypassing traditional intermediaries.</li>
        <li><strong>Users:</strong> By offering faster access to content and the ability to support creators and seeders directly through micropayments. They will be able to download a dedicated client application from our website to participate in the network.</li>
        <li><strong>The Network:</strong> By incentivizing participation (seeding) and ensuring its long-term health and decentralization through direct economic rewards.</li>
        <li><strong>New Business Enterprises:</strong> BitCDN will provide a foundational framework for the commercial distribution and consumption of media. This opens the door for innovative business models and enterprises to flourish in a more open and equitable digital content landscape, challenging the existing CDN paradigm.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We are building a client application that users can download from the project's website to easily connect to the BitCDN network, share files, and make/receive micropayments.</p>
